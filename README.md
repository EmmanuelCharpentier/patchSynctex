# patchSynctex : an utility for noweb-PDF synchronization

## What is this

This is the source repository of the CRAN package patchSynctex. People
wishing to access Jan Gleixner's patchKnitrSynctex may do so on its
own Github page <https://github.com/jan-glx/patchKnitrSynctex>. An
archival copy of its state when I forked this program is available at
<https://github.com/EmmanuelCharpentier/patchKnitrSynctex>, but is,
intentionally, not maintained.

I choose to ignore the standalone C++ program, which is difficult to
maintain cross-platform, and concentrated on the R version.

## How to use this

Install the package in your R installation and peruse the help pages
of the package.

Have fun !
